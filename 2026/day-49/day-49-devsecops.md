# Day 49 – DevSecOps: Add Security to Your CI/CD Pipeline

### Task 1: Scan Your Docker Image for Vulnerabilities
Your Docker image might use a base image with known security issues. Let's find out.

Add this step to your main branch pipeline (after Docker build, before deploy):
```yaml
- name: Scan Docker Image for Vulnerabilities
  uses: aquasecurity/trivy-action@master
  with:
    image-ref: 'your-username/your-app:latest'
    format: 'table'
    exit-code: '1'
    severity: 'CRITICAL,HIGH'
```

What this does:
- `trivy` scans your Docker image for known CVEs (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures)
- `format: 'table'` prints a readable table in the logs
- `exit-code: '1'` means **fail the pipeline** if CRITICAL or HIGH vulnerabilities are found
- If it passes, your image is clean — proceed to push and deploy

Push and check the Actions tab. Read the scan output.

### Task 2: Enable GitHub's Built-in Secret Scanning
GitHub can automatically detect if someone pushes a secret (API key, token, password) to your repo.

1. Go to your repo → Settings → **Code security and analysis**
2. Enable **Secret scanning**
3. If available, also enable **Push protection** — this blocks the push entirely if a secret is detected

That's it — no workflow changes needed. GitHub does this automatically.

Write in your notes:
- What is the difference between secret scanning and push protection?
   + secret scanning:
       + scans your whole repo history for leaked secrets
    
  + push protection:-
       + blocks the push if a secret is detected
         
- What happens if GitHub detects a leaked AWS key in your repo?
    + GitHub BLOCKS the push ❌ shows warning: "Secret detected! Push blocked!" your secret is safe!

  ### Task 3: Scan Dependencies for Known Vulnerabilities
If your app uses packages (pip, npm, etc.), those packages might have known vulnerabilities.

Add this to your **PR pipeline** (not the main pipeline):
```yaml
- name: Check Dependencies for Vulnerabilities
  uses: actions/dependency-review-action@v4
  with:
    fail-on-severity: critical
```

This checks any **new** dependencies added in the PR against a vulnerability database. If a dependency has a critical CVE, the PR check fails.

Test it:
1. Open a PR that adds a package to your app
2. Check the Actions tab — did the dependency review run?

**Verify:** Does the dependency review show up as a check on your PR?

---

### Task 4: Add Permissions to Your Workflows
By default, workflows get broad permissions. Lock them down.

Add this block near the top of your workflow files (after `on:`):
```yaml
permissions:
  contents: read
```

If a workflow needs to comment on PRs, add:
```yaml
permissions:
  contents: read
  pull-requests: write
```

Update at least 2 of your existing workflow files with a `permissions` block.

Write in your notes: Why is it a good practice to limit workflow permissions? What could go wrong if a compromised action has write access to your repo?
   + Default GitHub Actions permissions = read AND write to everything This is dangerous!
   + Compromised third party action | can write/delete your code ❌ | can only read ✅ |
   + | Malicious package in workflow | can push commits to your repo ❌ | blocked

     ### Task 5: See the Full Secure Pipeline
Look at what your pipeline does now:

```
PR opened
  → build & test
  → dependency vulnerability check     ← NEW (Day 49)
  → PR checks pass or fail

Merge to main
  → build & test
  → Docker build
  → Trivy image scan (fail on CRITICAL) ← NEW (Day 49)
  → Docker push (only if scan passes)
  → deploy

Always active
  → GitHub secret scanning              ← NEW (Day 49)
  → push protection for secrets         ← NEW (Day 49)
```

Draw this diagram in your notes. You just built a **DevSecOps pipeline** — security is now part of your automation, not an afterthought.
Layer 1 → secret scanning          stops leaked secrets 

  Layer 2 → dependency review        stops vulnerable packages 
  
  Layer 3 → trivy image scan         stops vulnerable images 
  
  Layer 4 → manual approval          stops accidental deploys 
  
  Layer 5 → health check             catches broken deploys
